# ![Disaster Tweet Classification using NLP](https://github.com/AniMilina/Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets/blob/main/cover_2.jpg)

Welcome to my project for the [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started?rvi=1) on Kaggle! In this project, I tackled the challenge of classifying tweets as either real disaster-related or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Overview
Twitter has become a crucial platform for sharing real-time information, including during emergencies. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically distinguish between tweets that discuss actual disasters and those that use disaster-related terms metaphorically or in other contexts.

## What I Did
- **Data Exploration:** I started by exploring the provided dataset containing 10,000 labeled tweets. I analyzed the structure of the data, identified key features, and visualized trends.

- **Data Preprocessing:** I prepared the data by cleaning and tokenizing the text. I also addressed missing values and applied techniques like TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- **Model Selection:** I experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Passive Aggressive Classifier, and more. I fine-tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation to optimize model performance.

- **Evaluation:** To evaluate model performance, I used the F1-score metric, which considers both precision and recall. I ensured that the model was performing well on the test set by predicting labels and comparing them with the actual values.

- **Results:** I visualized the results of different algorithms, showcasing their F1-scores. This helped me understand which algorithm performed best for this specific task.

- **GitHub Repository:** I documented my project's code, explanations, and results in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AniMilina/Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets). You can find the Jupyter Notebook and other resources here.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and set up a Python environment.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see step-by-step code and analysis.
3. Experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters to see how they affect performance.
4. Share your feedback or suggestions â€“ I'm always open to learning and improving!
